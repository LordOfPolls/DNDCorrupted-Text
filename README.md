# DNDCorrupted-Text

A simple python file that corrupts text to challenge your players. It can handle ``.docx``, ``.txt`` and ``.pdf`` files.

This script requires the modules ``docx2txt``,``tkinter`` and ``PyPDF2`` to run

##### Note on PDF support:
This script will only ever read **2** pages at most. This is because processing PDF pages takes a long time, and it isnt effective to read an entire book just to corrupt it.
